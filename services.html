      <p>We’re just getting started! As more of our neighbors sign up, this is where you’ll be able to browse the services, skills, and knowledge shared within our community.</p>
      <p>If you have something to offer — whether it’s fixing a fence, baking amazing bread, tutoring kids, or helping with tech — <a href="index.html#add-service">add your service</a> today. Every new listing makes this directory more useful for everyone.</p>
      <p>Think of it as keeping our resources close to home, where trust runs deep and helping hands are just a few houses away.</p>
